A simple example using formhub.R -- good eats
========================================================

formhub.R makes is easy to download and work with datasets on formhub.R. After downloading, formhub.R post-processes your dataset to convert the different columns to the correct type, which it derives from the `type` you specified during the creation of your XLSform.

Let us illustrate this with a simple example:



```r
# Download the dataset named good_eats in the account of mberg
source("../formhub.R")
good_eats <- formhubDownload("good_eats", "mberg")
```




The downloaded data has its fields converted to the right types, something we'll look at in depth later. Before we do that, lets present a quick example of the power of these conversions by looking at dates. Can we look at how much data mberg has been submitting over time?



```r
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data = good_eats, x = submit_date) + ylab("Submission Count")
```

![plot of chunk plot1](figure/plot1.png) 


How about riskiness of the food he is trying and reporting about... has that changed over time?


```r
qplot(data = good_eats, x = submit_date, fill = risk_factor)
```

![plot of chunk plot2](figure/plot2.png) 

Looks like it has! mberg's getting riskier as time goes on.
