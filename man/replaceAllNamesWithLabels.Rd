}
\arguments{

\description{
ona Objects have some data, as well as the form, which documents how
the data was obtained through a survey. The data, by default, is represented by
slugs, ie, items in the `name` column in the original xfrom. This function
replaces slugs in the header with actual question text, and replaces slugs in
select one options with the actual resposne text.
}
\examples{
good_eats <- onaDownload("good_eats", "mberg","mberg")
names(good_eats) # still slugged names
summary(good_eats$rating)
good_eats_readable <- replaceAllNamesWithLabels(good_eats)
names(good_eats_readable) # not slugged anymore
summary(good_eats_readable$`Risk Factor`) # not slugged anymore.
