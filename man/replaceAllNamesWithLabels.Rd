\description{
formhub Objects have some data, as well as the form, which
documents how the data was obtained through a survey. The
data, by default, is represented by slugs, ie, items in the
`name` column in the original xfrom. This function replaces
slugs in the header with actual question text, and replaces
slugs in select one options with the actual resposne text.
}
\examples{
good_eats <- formhubDownload("good_eats", "mberg")
names(good_eats) # still slugged names
summary(good_eats$rating)
good_eats_readable <- replaceAllNamesWithLabels(good_eats)
names(good_eats_readable) # not slugged anymore
summary(good_eats_readable$`Risk Factor`) # not slugged anymore.
