formhub.R News

Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.8.2 (Dec 09, 2013):
 * handle forms with itemsets (at a cursory level) 

Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.8.1 (Nov 26, 2013):
 * make sure RJSONIO is higher than version 0.96; use RJSONIO explicitly in fromJSON calls

Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.8 (Nov 18, 2013):
 * replace*NamesWithLabels no longer return formhubData objects, they return data.frames
 * replaceAllNamesWithLabels will now work with multi-lingual forms, you have to pass in the language of your options

Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.7 (Sept 17, 2013):

 * implemented a keepGroupNames=T argument to formhubRead. Make keepGroupNames FALSE, and formhub will discard group names from your dataframe, which can make it easier to manage.

Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.6.2 (Sept 16, 2013):

 * replace*NamesWithLabels now *should* work on forms with weird characters that R replaced with dot

Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.6.1 (Sept 13, 2013):

 * Made it so that the type column in formDFs remain as character. The factor was doing funky things on rbind.fill.

Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.6 (Sept 03, 2013):

 * added a replaceAllNamesWithLables function that will replace 'slugs' within select one data, as well as the question, with the label text.
 
Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.5 (Sept 03, 2013):

 * added as.SpatialPointsDataFrame function that drops all invalid gps points, and returns a SpatialPointsDataFrame
 * added convert.dates option to formhub(Read|Download|Cast)

Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.2 (June 28, 2013):

 * suppressing warnings when doing type conversion according to formhub types

Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.1 (May 24, 2013):

 * `formhubData`, the class of objects that formhub* functions return, is now inherited from data.frame, and the @data property has been removed. What this means is that you can do ordinary data.frame operations (example: `head`, `names`, `nrow`) on formhubData objects, which makes usage more convenient.
 * Demo files have been updated to reflect the change above.
